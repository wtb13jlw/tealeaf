Quiz: Lesson 1

Some exercises from lesson 1 materials:

1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?


  a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3

Answer: a = 1  Strings are not mutable.


2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

Answer: An array is a list of items indexed by an integer.  A hash has a key/value pairing.  The Key can be any object and is used to index into
        the hash to retrieve the Values.


3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!

Answer:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
         [1, 2, 3]
         [1, 2, 3] 


4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

Answer: map returns a new array with cahnges made by the code block.  select returns a new array containing only the items for which a
        true condition is returned by the block.


5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

Answer: hash = { "key1" => "a", "key2" => "b", ...}


6. What is returned?

  x = 1

  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

Answer: "no way"  -  (Tricky question.  I missed it, until I saw the answers)  


7. What is x?


  x = 1

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

Answer: x = 4


8. What is x?

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

Answer: Error. x has not been defined before being used either inside the loop or out.  Even if defined 
        in the loop, it still would have failed outside.
